# <h1 align="center">**Muffin but the truth**</h1>

<p>Curious and passionate about systems and coding, I'm on a journey to discover where my interests lie in the vast world of tech.</p>

- 🌱 I’m currently following the **Common Core at 42 Lyon**.
- 🔧 Arch user 🔨 trying to not break anything.
- 💬 Ask me about **[LeekScript](https://leekwars.com/encyclopedia/en/LeekScript)** - The garden where I started to code : I raised with love, organic code, and a sprinkle of compostable functions, my very first Leek AI 🥬.
- ⚡ Grab a **fork** and have a **byte**, so you can **test** by yourself 😋.
  Please, before leaving, **make** it **fclean**.

### Currently focusing on :

- 💻 **C & C++ system programming.**
- 🐧 **Linux system.**
- 📜 **Bash scripting.**
- 🦀 **Rust programming.**

### Ongoing Projects:

- <strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/42_scripts">📜 42 scripts</a></strong>: A collection of Bash scripts designed to streamline common tasks at 42 Lyon, such as automation, testing, project setup...
- <strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/Muffinette">🧁 **Muffinette**</a></strong>: A minishell-minitester, execute a sequence of inputs in minishell and bash and compare outputs to streamline tests.
- ♟️ **Rust Chess Game**: Developing a chess game to learn Rust and deepen my understanding of low level languages.
- 📄 **dotfiles**: My minimalists homemade config files. 


### Realized projects:
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/fract-ol">💫 Fractol</a> - A simple fractals explorer coded in C for my 42 cursus.</strong></li>
    Featuring Mandelbrot, Julia sets and a lot more. This project involved optimizing rendering algorithms for performance using the MinilibX graphics library.
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/ChessReplay">🔁 ChessReplay</a> - A simple PGN decoder and chess replayer written in C.</strong></li>
I started this project after my piscine, to apply what I learned on a personnal project. It involved parsing PGN files from Lichess database, learning data structures, and implementing a text-based chessboard visualization.
</ul>
