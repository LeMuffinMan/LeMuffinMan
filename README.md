# <h1 align="center">I'm Muffin ! 🧁</h1>

<p>Curious and passionate about systems and coding, I'm on a journey to discover where my interests lie in the vast world of tech.</p>

- 🌱 I’m currently following the **common core at 42 Lyon**.
- 💬 Ask me about **[LeekScript](https://leekwars.com/encyclopedia/en/LeekScript)** - The garden where I raised with love, organic code, and a sprinkle of compostable functions, my very first Leek algorithmic AI 🥬.
- ⚡ **Muffin** but the truth : While the cake **lied**, the **pye overclocked** ! You would not refuse my **cookies** ? Grab a **fork** and have a **byte**, so you can **test** by yourself 😋. Please, before leaving, **make** it **fclean**.

### Currently focusing on :

- 💻 **C & C++ system programming.**
- 🐧 **Linux system.**
- 📜 **Bash scripting.**
- 🦀 **Rust programming.**

<h2 align="center">Featured Projects</h2>

### Realized projects:
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/fract-ol">💫 Fractol</a> - A simple fractals explorer coded in C for my 42 cursus.</strong></li>
    Featuring Mandelbrot, Julia sets and a lot more. This project involved optimizing rendering algorithms for performance and creating an interactive user interface using the MinilibX graphics library.
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/ChessReplay">🔁 ChessReplay</a> - A simple PGN decoder and chess replayer written in C.</strong></li>
This project involved parsing PGN files from Lichess database, learning data structures, and implementing a text-based chessboard visualization. I coded it in between my piscine and the beginning of my 42 cursus to apply in a personal project, what I learned during my piscine.
</ul>

### Ongoing Projects:

- <strong><a href="https://github.com/dArchMuffin/42_scripts">📜 42 scripts</a></strong> A collection of Bash scripts designed to streamline common tasks at 42 Lyon, such as automation, testing, and project setup.
- ♟️ **Rust Chess Game**: Developing a chess game to learn Rust and deepen my understanding of low level languages.
