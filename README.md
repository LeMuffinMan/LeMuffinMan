# <h1 align="center">**Muffin but the truth**</h1>

<p>Curious and passionate about systems and coding, I'm on a journey to discover where my interests lie in the vast world of tech.</p>

- 🌱 I’m currently following the **Common Core at 42 Lyon**.
- 🔧 Arch user 🔨 trying to not break anything.
- 💬 Ask me about **[LeekScript](https://leekwars.com/encyclopedia/en/LeekScript)** - The garden where I started to code : I raised with organic code my very first Leek AI 🥬.
- ⚡ Grab a **fork** and have a **byte**, so you can **test** by yourself 😋.

### Currently focusing on :

- 💻 **C & C++ system programming.**
- 🦀 **Rust programming.**
- 🐧 **Linux system.**

<h2 align="center">Featured Projects</h2>

### Ongoing project:

- <strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/ChessGame">**♟️ Rust Chess Game**</a></strong>: Developing a chess game to learn Rust and deepen my understanding of low level languages, webassembly and CI/CD.

### Realized projects:
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/PasswordGenerator.rs">🔒 PasswordGenerator.rs</a> </strong> - A simple password generator realized as an exercise to learn Rust basics.</li> 
Using crates Clap for a reliable and user-friendly CLI, and Serde to parse TOML config file or output settings as JSON.
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/bash2rust">📜🦀 Bash2Rust</a></strong>: a Rust wrapper for my collection of Bash scripts designed for and during the 42 Common Core.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/Muffinette">🧁 Muffinette</a></strong>: A suite of Bash scripts I’m developing using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach as part of my preparation for the 42 minishell project.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/fract-ol">💫 Fractol</a> - A simple fractals explorer coded in C for my 42 cursus.</strong></li>
    Featuring Mandelbrot, Julia sets and a lot more, including an animated fractal generator. This project involved optimizing rendering algorithms for performance using the MinilibX graphics library.
    <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/ChessReplay">🔁 ChessReplay</a> - A simple PGN decoder and chess replayer written in C.</strong></li>
Coded after my piscine, to apply what I learned on a personnal project. It involved parsing PGN files from Lichess database, learning data structures, and implementing a text-based chessboard visualization.
</ul>

### Miscellaneous:
- <strong><a href="https://o-h-m.netlify.app">**📸 Personal Photography site**</a></strong>: My personnal photography realized with Hugo and deployed with Netlify.
- <strong><a href="https://github.com/LeMuffinMan/Dotfiles">**📄 Dotfiles**</a></strong>: My minimalists homemade (and borrowed) dotfiles for Hyprland, Waybar, Kitty, Neovim and more.
